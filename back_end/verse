To print out all the enumerators `:014:0 = bible.books.first.chapters.first.verses`, we need to break down the individual components of the enumerator and retrieve the values they represent. Here's how you can print out each component:

1. `bible.books` - This part suggests that there is a variable named `bible` that contains a collection of books. You need to access the `first` book in this collection to proceed to the next level.

2. `bible.books.first` - This part accesses the first book in the collection of books. To continue, we need to access the chapters of this first book.

3. `bible.books.first.chapters` - This accesses the collection of chapters within the first book. You'll need to fetch the first chapter in this collection to proceed.

4. `bible.books.first.chapters.first` - This accesses the first chapter within the collection of chapters in the first book. Finally, you need to access the verses within this chapter.

5. `bible.books.first.chapters.first.verses` - This refers to the collection of verses within the first chapter of the first book in the `bible` variable. You can then loop through these verses and print them out.

To print out all the enumerators, you can use a loop to iterate over each verse in the `bible.books.first.chapters.first.verses` collection and print them out individually. Here is a sample code snippet in Ruby to demonstrate this:

```ruby
bible.books.first.chapters.first.verses.each do |verse|
  puts verse
end
```

This code will iterate over each verse in the specified enumerator and print out its value. Make sure to adjust the syntax and method calls based on the programming language or environment you are working in.
